# ArgBind: binding function arguments to the command line

ArgBind is a simple way to bind arguments to functions to the command line. It
also supports scoping of arguments, similar to other frameworks like 
[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) and
[gin-config](https://github.com/google/gin-config). Unlike these other frameworks,
ArgBind is *very* small, can be used to make super simple command
line programs with help text loaded directly from docstrings, and is only ~400 lines.
